## Problem  

* Lack of water quality information to establish reference conditions increases uncertainty in management targets  
* Monitoring is typically reactive and starts after an impact has already occurred  
  + For example: large cyanobacterial blooms are detected so studies examine nutrient sources and modern lake water chemistry.  

## Model
Simulated data was generated according to an individual-based game-theoretical model. The parameter of resource division was used to simulate the evolution of an algae population in a lake according to individual behavior. The simulation predicts that the algae population will tend towards a population that produces more chlorophyll *a*. It is of interest to compare the model with the field work data collected.

## Paleolimnology  
* Uses biological, physical and chemical indicators preserved in lake sediments to reconstruct past environmental changes.  
* Visible Range Spectroscopy (VRS) can be used to infer past whole-lake the concentrations of chlorophyll *a* and its degradation products.  
  
[chlorophyll *a* + derivatives] = 0.0919$\times$peak area*~650-700nm~*+0.0011
  
## Research Questions and Significance
  
We aim to explore the environmental histories of previously unmonitored lakes to inform local lake managers and present exploratory results from the application of machine learning to paleolimnological spectral data and chlorophyll *a* reconstructions.
  
1. Does chlorophyll *a* change over time in each lake?  
2. Can we differentiate absorbance values from lakes grouped by trophic status or depth using machine learning?
+ If so, are the primary differences in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) range, or are they in other biologically-relevant spectra?
  
## Methods  

* Cores were dated at PEARL via gamma spectroscopy and calculated using a Constant Rate of Supply (CRS) Model using ^210^Pb activities. 
* A Model 6500 series Rapid Content Analyzer at PEARL was used to produce the absorbance values for our study lakes.

### Data Layout 
#### PAR Layout
* **Column 1-51**: values from the spectrophotometer for wavelengths 400-2500nm, measured every 2nm.
* **Column 52**: Midpoint depth of the sediment interval.

#### FullVRS Layout
* **Column 1**: Sampled wavelengths (400-2500nm).
* **Column 2-n**: Absorbance values for sampled intervals (in first row as midpoint depth in cm).
